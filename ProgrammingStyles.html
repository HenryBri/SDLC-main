<button class="accordion">Behavior-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an Agile software development methodology in which an application is documented and 
        designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it. By encouraging developers to 
        focus only on the requested behaviors of an app or program, BDD helps to avoid bloat, excessive code, unnecessary features 
        or lack of focus. This methodology combines, augments and refines the practices used in test-driven development 
        and acceptance testing. 
    </p>

<button class="accordion">Design-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to 
        build better, more informed technology solutions. It can also be looked at as a process whereby design and user 
        experience drives the development of a product or software application. This leads to products that people enjoy using 
        and want to tell others about.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Domain-driven design</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modelling software to match a domain according 
        to input from that domain's experts. In terms of object-oriented programming it means that the structure and 
        language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, 
        if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such 
        as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.

<button class="accordion">Secure by design</button>
<div class="panel">
   <p>Secure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be 
        foundationally secure. Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software 
        design, and the best are selected and enforced by the architecture, and they are used as guiding principles for developers. 
        It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even though those design 
        patterns were not originally devised with security in mind. Secure by Design is increasingly becoming the mainstream 
        development approach to ensure security and privacy of software systems. In this approach, security is considered and built 
        into the system at every layer and starts with a robust architecture design. Security architectural design decisions are 
        based on well-known security strategies, tactics, and patterns defined as reusable techniques for achieving specific quality 
        concerns. Security tactics/patterns provide solutions for enforcing the necessary authentication, authorization, confidentiality, 
        data integrity, privacy, accountability, availability, safety and non-repudiation requirements, even when the system is under 
        attack. In order to ensure the security of a software system, not only is it important to design a robust intended security 
        architecture but it is also necessary to map updated security strategies, tactics and patterns to software development in 
        order to maintain security persistence.

<button class="accordion">Test-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
   <p>Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test 
        cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against 
        all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Acceptance test-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) is a development methodology based on communication between the business 
        customers, the developers, and the testers. ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by 
        example (SBE), behavior-driven development (BDD), example-driven development (EDD), and support-driven 
        development also called story test-driven development (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in 
        understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own 
        domain language. ATDD is closely related to test-driven development (TDD). It differs by the emphasis on 
        developer-tester-business customer collaboration. ATDD encompasses acceptance testing, but highlights writing 
        acceptance tests before developers begin coding.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Continuous test-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Continuous test-driven development (CTDD) is a software development practice that extends test-driven development 
        (TDD) by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing.
        In CTDD the developer writes a test first but is not forced to execute the tests manually. The tests are run 
        automatically by a continuous testing tool running in the background. This technique can potentially reduce the time 
        waste resulting from manual test execution by eliminating the need for the developer to start the test after each phase 
        of the normal TDD practice: after writing the (initially failing) test, after producing the minimal amount of code for 
        the test to pass and after refactoring the code.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Specification by example</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Specification by example (SBE) is a collaborative approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional 
        tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of 
        abstract statements. It is applied in the context of agile software development methods, in particular 
        behavior-driven development. This approach is particularly successful for managing requirements and functional tests 
        on large-scale projects of significant domain and organisational complexity.
        Specification by example is intended to construct an accurate understanding, and significantly reduces feedback loops 
        in software development, leading to less rework, higher product quality, faster turnaround time for software changes and 
        better alignment of activities of various roles involved in software development such as testers, analysts and developers.

<button class="accordion">Data-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Data-driven software development is based on solid metrics like Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or Objectives And 
        Key Results (OKRs). Clear, objective, and unambiguous, these metrics encourage dev teams to think about the 
        long-term strategic objectives of their day-to-day work and the business value of each project. The data allows these 
        teams and individuals to visualize how their work contributes to business success, and how they can support the organization 
        in meeting its vital goals.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Data-oriented design</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>In computing, data-oriented design is a program optimization approach motivated by efficient usage of the CPU cache, used 
        in video game development. The approach is to focus on the data layout, separating and sorting fields according to 
        when they are needed, and to think about transformations of data.
